# Beta Testing

Before you [submit your plugin](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Releasing/Submit+your+plugin), you may want to let users try it out first. While Obsidian doesn't officially support beta releases, we recommend that you use the [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin to distribute your plugin to beta testers before it's been published.

For more information, refer to the [BRAT](https://tfthacker.com/BRAT) documentation.
