# Conventional Commits

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for every commit message.

## Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

- **type** (required): One of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`.
- **scope** (optional): Area of the codebase (e.g. `api`, `ui`, `plugin`).
- **description** (required): Short imperative summary, no period at the end.

## Examples

```text
feat: add FSRS scheduling for atomic notes
feat(settings): add retention curve display
fix: correct due date calculation for new cards
docs: update README installation steps
refactor(plugin): extract review logic into service
chore: bump dependencies
```

## Rules

- Use lowercase for type and scope.
- Keep the subject line under ~72 characters.
- Use the imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature" or "adds feature".
- Reference issues in the footer when relevant: `Fixes #123` or `Closes #45`.

When suggesting or writing commit messages, always use this format.
